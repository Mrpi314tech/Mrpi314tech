I like creating AI tools to make the AI assitant experience better and easier to use. Here are some of my models and tools:

### Projects

- **[Classy](https://github.com/eedeb/Classy)**: Classy is a python module that utilizes AI to classify natural language into categories for processing with other models and tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Dall-E, Search_Scrape, and CustomChat.
